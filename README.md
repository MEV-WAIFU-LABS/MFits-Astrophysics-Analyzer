## mfits: a tool for statistical analysis of x-ray bursters

<br>

##### 👉🏼 this package can calculate up to five distinct fits for the data generated from x-ray atmospheric simulations
##### 👉🏼 read the e-book i wrote on **[the physics of x-ray bursters](https://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/reviews/xrb_review.pdf)**
##### 👉🏼 this research was peer-reviewed and published it the **[astrophysical journal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/832/2/102)**
##### 👉🏼 read my paper on [the x-ray bursters problem and its implications to the equation of state of the cold dense matter](https://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/reviews/xrays.pdf)

### running the code

<br>

1) the data to be analyzed should be inside ```/data``` directory
2) the names/paths for the above data should be changed into the constant files at ```/src/constants.py```
3) run ```/src/main.py```
4) you should get the outputs under the folder `/output` and a log file under ```/logs/```
