INTRODUCTION
-------------

This code is part of the studies on XRB NS atmosphere models. Here 
we follow the analysis performed by by Suleimanov et al (2010),
reproducing their five fittings (non-linear least square method) 
on the color factor (fc) for 20 NS luminosities (l=L/L_Edd), 
6 chemical compositions, and 3 surface  gravities (log g). 


------------
DATA SOURCE
------------

The Suleimanov et al (2010) data was available as 18 sets of models at:
http://astro.uni-tuebingen.de/~suleiman/web_burst/
For each set, the first line gives the hydrogen (or helium) mass 
fraction, the metal mass fraction, the gravity log g, the Eddington 
temperature T_Edd, the NS radius, and the redshift.  The 2nd line 
lists 20 relative luminosities, and the 3rd lines gives the effective 
temperatures in keV. The following 276 lines contain 21 columns, 
where the 1st column is photon energy E (keV) and the columns 2-21 
are the different values of l and T_Eff for 20 values of the 
flux (F_E) in units (erg cm^-2 s^-1 keV^-1, i.e. H_E), such that
\int_0^{\infty} F_E dE  = \sigma_SB T_eff^4.



-----------------
RUNNING THE CODE
-----------------

1) Check the requirements:
Python 2.6 or higher
scipy
numpy
matlibplot

3) Modify the initial inputs (dataset, xo) in src/main.py

2) Run /src/main.py

OUTPUTS
--------
 
The outputs of this code can be seen in the folder output/. They consist
of a text file with all fcs and ws and plots for the figures 3,7,8,9, and
10 of SPW2010.
