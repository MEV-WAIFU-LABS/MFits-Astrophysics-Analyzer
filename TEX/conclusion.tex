\section{Conclusions}


Thermonuclear X-ray bursts are an useful tool for inferring neutron stars masses and radii. These quantities can be related to the to the local Eddington flux on the stellar surface, when studying a subset of very bright thermonuclear bursts, the PRE bursts. However, systematic and statistical errors in these calculations currently do not allow to pin down the equation of state describing the interior and evolution of the neutron stars.

\quad

In this work,  we have reproduced five modules for fitting a diluted blackbody spectra to simulations of neutron star atmospheres presenting PRE X-ray bursts, based on the work performed by \cite{SPW10}. In addition, we have successfully tested these modules on the new models simulated by the LANL group.

\quad

With this verified technique, the next step is to explore these atmospheres' parameters and to extend the present models, in order to reduce the uncertainties on determining masses and radii of neutron stars from observed X-ray bursts. These calculations may allow us to finally constrain the equation of state of the cold ultra-dense matter.
