\begin{abstract}
We review the understating on {\it X-ray bursting neutron stars}, particularly the thermonuclear instabilities on accretion stars that produce {\it thermonuclear (Type-I) X-ray bursts}. These bursts are caused by unstable burning in the outer layers of the neutron star due to accreted material from a companion in a close binary system.  When these objects are bright enough, the local X-ray luminosity in the atmosphere may approach the Eddington limit. In these cases, photospheric layers can be lifted off from the neutron star surface by radiation pressure. Objects that present {\it photospheric radius expansion} (PRE) are the most prominent tool to simultaneously determine the {\it radii and masses of neutron stars}, necessary to constrain the {\it equation of state of the cold dense matter}. However, a sufficiently extended set of models for neutron star atmospheres is necessary for these investigations. In this paper, we derive the necessary calculation  to understand the X-ray bursters problem and present preliminary results  for the atmospheric {\it color correction factors}.
